## Research Interests

### The Quest for Ethical AI: Fighting Hate Speech with Fairness

Masters in ML & AI (by Research) | Liverpool John Moores University | 2024-2025

In the digital age, hate speech has become a pandemic of its own—spreading faster than any content moderation system can contain. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle with the nuances of human malice: the coded language, the context-dependent slurs, the implicit biases that slip through algorithmic cracks.

**My research asks a critical question:** Can we build AI systems that are not only effective at detecting hate speech, but also fundamentally fair across different communities?

**Research Focus: Persona-Based & Policy-Based Hate Speech Detection**

I'm pioneering a novel approach that unifies persona-based and policy-based signals within Large Language Models for hate speech detection. Think of it as teaching AI to understand not just what is being said, but who it's targeting and why it's harmful.

**The Innovation:**
- Developed a Modular Prompt Validation Framework that systematically evaluates different detection strategies
- Integrated both Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation
- Achieved F1-score of 0.669 on GPT-OSS-20B with superior real-world generalization

**Why It Matters:**
Most AI systems exhibit bias—they're better at protecting some communities than others. My work explicitly addresses three high-prevalence personas: LGBTQ+, Mexican, and Middle East communities, using rigorously balanced datasets (HateXplain and ToxiGen) with over 5,000 carefully curated social media posts.

**Methodology: Science Meets Ethics**

- **Unified Corpus:** 5,151 English social media posts with stratified demographic representation
- **Fairness-First Design:** Explicit balancing across demographic groups and hate/normal content
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Strictly held-out test sets prevent data contamination and ensure reproducibility
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Multiple ablation studies across GPT-OSS (20B, 120B) and GPT-5

**Real-World Impact**

This isn't just academic research—it's about making social media platforms safer and fairer for everyone. The framework provides a scalable, reproducible path for platforms like X (Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit to implement context-sensitive, fairness-aware moderation systems.
