## About Me

Think of me as an architect who doesn't just design buildings—I design entire cities of code, orchestrate symphonies of microservices, and lead expeditions into uncharted technological territories. For over two decades, I've been at the intersection of ambition and execution, turning abstract possibilities into concrete realities that millions of people use every day.

My story began with a single line of code in 2003. Fast forward through twenty years of continuous evolution: from writing my first loops to architecting cloud platforms that power Fortune 10 companies, from managing my first team to building organizations from scratch, from debugging production incidents to pioneering fairness-aware AI systems.

But here's what truly drives me—it's never been about the technology alone. It's about the student who can now learn physics through an AI tutor. It's about the Walmart shopper who finds exactly what they need in milliseconds. It's about the doctor whose medical device seamlessly connects to the cloud, enabling better patient care. Technology is my canvas; impact is my masterpiece.

Today, as I lead Microsoft Azure's AI model platform while pursuing research in ethical AI, I'm driven by a singular belief: the most powerful technology is the kind that serves all of humanity equitably. The future isn't just about building faster systems—it's about building fairer ones.

## Professional Journey

### Microsoft Azure AI | 2024 - Present
**Director of Engineering – Azure AI Platform (IDC Site Lead)**

*When they asked me to build an AI platform, I built a movement.*

Picture this: March 2024. I walk into an empty office in Bangalore. No team. No infrastructure. Just a vision—to establish India as a strategic AI delivery hub for Microsoft Azure. Fast forward to today: a thriving organization of 40+ engineers, architects, and managers shipping AI models to millions of users worldwide. This is the story of building something from absolute zero.

**Act I: The Foundation**

They say the hardest part of any journey is the first step. In my case, it was the first hundred steps—all taken simultaneously. As the sole founding member, I wore every hat imaginable: developer writing code at 2 AM, architect designing systems, recruiter interviewing candidates, strategist building roadmaps, and diplomat forging alliances with sister teams across the globe.

The mission was audacious: compete with established peer products while building competency in a brand new delivery center. Most people would call that ambitious. I called it Tuesday.

**Act II: First Blood**

Our first major delivery was performance benchmarking capabilities—not just a feature, but a strategic differentiator. We competed head-to-head with two established products and won. The innovation was productionized and became the cornerstone of Azure's model evaluation strategy. 

This wasn't luck. It was intentional excellence. We proved that India wasn't just a cost center—it was an innovation powerhouse.

**Act III: Going Global**

Then came the model launches. DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, Cohere—each one a strategic initiative requiring flawless execution. Leading from the front, I coordinated cross-team efforts, navigated technical complexities, and ensured that tight deadlines became launch celebrations rather than missed milestones.

These weren't just deployments. They were statements: India delivers at global scale, with global quality.

**The Platform Evolution**

While launching models, we simultaneously incubated the Model Scaling Platform competency from ground zero. Built the capability. Assembled the delivery pod. Rolled out Unified RP (Resource Provider) and comprehensive Observability solutions—all from IDC. The technical depth wasn't accidental; it was cultivated through rigorous learning, experimentation, and a culture that celebrated both success and intelligent failure.

**The Zero-Ops Revolution**

Here's where we got creative. Traditional model onboarding took weeks of manual intervention—a bottleneck that was killing agility. So we built a self-serve system that eliminated human intervention entirely. Automated workflows, intelligent validation, seamless integration. Result? 40% reduction in onboarding time. What used to take weeks now takes days.

This wasn't just efficiency—it was liberation. Engineers could focus on innovation instead of toil.

**Operational Mastery**

With growth comes chaos—unless you build systems that self-heal. We implemented healing features in Model Pool Buildout that increased resolution capacity by 33% and slashed redundant incidents by 15%. The platform didn't just scale; it got smarter with every incident.

**The Culture Multiplier**

Technology is replicable. Culture isn't. I built an organization where every engineer feels ownership, where managers lead with empathy, where architects mentor generously, and where innovation is celebrated loudly. From 1 to 40+ isn't just a hiring achievement—it's a community-building miracle.

Today, when someone asks what I do at Microsoft, I don't say "I manage the Azure Model Platform." I say, "I'm building the future of AI—one brilliant mind at a time."

### Walmart Labs | 2018 - 2024  
**Director of Engineering – Search & ML Platform**

*Where millions of searches become discoveries, and data science becomes rocket fuel.*

Imagine being responsible for the system that determines whether a customer finds what they're looking for—or gives up and goes to Amazon. That was my world at Walmart: high stakes, massive scale, zero tolerance for failure. Every millisecond mattered. Every algorithm tweak could swing millions in revenue. And every team decision rippled across hundreds of millions of customers.

**The Search Symphony**

I didn't just manage a search engine—I orchestrated an entire ecosystem. From the moment a customer starts typing (typeahead) to the final results they see (backend), from the algorithms that rank products (runtime) to the massive indexes that power it all—my teams touched every note in this complex symphony.

**The Vision Center Victory**

Sometimes, impact is personal. We transformed how customers discover prescription eyewear and vision care services. The result? A 50% leap in conversion rates. But numbers don't tell the full story—we helped people find healthcare they needed, making it as easy to order glasses online as it was to buy groceries.

**Deep Links: The Hidden Door**

Ever notice how some searches show you quick shortcuts—"Store Hours," "Pharmacy Refill," "Vision Center Near Me"? That was us. We built an A/B tested approach using data-driven prefix analysis that increased Health & Wellness service discoverability by 8-10 basis points. Small percentage, massive impact—millions of customers finding critical services faster.

**The Experimentation Engine**

Here's where it gets interesting. Walmart runs thousands of experiments constantly—testing new algorithms, trying different ranking strategies, optimizing every pixel of the search experience. My team built the platform that makes this possible safely. 

We created an Experiment Evaluation system that validates changes before they touch real customers, expanded A/B test buckets without risking business metrics, and maintained operational benchmarks that kept Search Site Relevance consistently high. The platform served everyone from operations teams to data scientists to board members—each needing different insights, all getting them from one unified system.

The secret sauce? We increased benchmarking throughput by 15% while introducing ML-based quality control that reduced error rates by 8% and maintained 98% accuracy. In experimentation, speed and precision aren't opposites—they're partners.

**The ML Platform Revolution**

But my proudest achievement was something entirely new: the Search ML Platform. Think LinkedIn's Pro-ML or Uber's Michelangelo, but purpose-built for Walmart's search ecosystem.

The problem was clear: data scientists were spending weeks on infrastructure grunt work—setting up pipelines, managing artifacts, deploying models—time they should have spent on actual science. So we built them a playground.

**The platform covered everything:**
- ML Experimentation and Pipelines
- Feature Engineering at scale
- Model Repository with lineage tracking
- Artifact Lifecycle management
- Deployment automation
- Metrics and monitoring

**The results were staggering:**
- 200% year-over-year growth in active users
- Zero churn from inception (unheard of for an internal platform)
- Training time collapsed from 1 week to 2 days
- Experimentation velocity 10x'd

But here's the real kicker: the platform enabled experiments in Query Understanding and Reranking that contributed to $500M in topline lift. Not supported—enabled. We didn't just build infrastructure; we built a business outcomes multiplier.

**Going Global**

The platform was so successful that we collaborated with Walmart's global platform teams to expand it beyond search into the broader Data Science ecosystem. What started as a search tool became a company-wide capability.

**The Leadership Lesson**

Building platforms is easy. Building platforms that people love and actually use? That's an art. We achieved it by obsessing over user experience, maintaining zero downtime, providing generous documentation, and treating our data scientists as customers—because they were.

### GE Healthcare | 2014 - 2018
**Principal Architect – Edison AI IIoT (GE Health Cloud)**

*When reliability means life or death, 99.9% isn't good enough.*

There's a special kind of pressure that comes with healthcare technology. When your systems connect to devices monitoring patients in ICUs, when your pipelines carry data that could detect early signs of disease, when downtime doesn't just cost money but could cost lives—you don't get to have bad days.

At GE Healthcare, I was part of something revolutionary: building the Edison AI Cloud, the nervous system connecting billions of medical devices worldwide to intelligent analytics. This wasn't just cloud engineering—it was mission-critical infrastructure where failure wasn't an option.

**The Healthcare IoT Challenge**

Imagine this: A hospital in Mumbai has 200 connected medical devices. A clinic in rural Texas has 50. A research facility in Berlin has 500. Each device generates continuous data streams—vitals, diagnostics, alerts. All of it needs to flow securely into analytics pipelines that can detect patterns, predict failures, and ultimately save lives.

Now multiply that by thousands of facilities globally. Add regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, local privacy laws). Layer on cybersecurity threats targeting healthcare infrastructure. Oh, and do it all with five-nines reliability because doctors depend on this data to make life-or-death decisions.

That was my problem space.

**The Architecture of Trust**

I architected a secure IoT ingestion pipeline operating at Amazon IoT-class scale with healthcare-grade security. This wasn't off-the-shelf cloud deployment—every design decision balanced competing constraints:

- **Scale vs. Security:** Handling gigabytes of data per second while ensuring every byte was encrypted, authenticated, and compliant
- **Latency vs. Reliability:** Real-time data flow without dropping packets, even during network disruptions
- **Flexibility vs. Safety:** Easy device onboarding without compromising the trust backbone

The result was an Amazon IoT-class agent that medical device manufacturers could trust, IT administrators could manage, and clinicians could depend on.

**Building the Data Lake**

Raw data is useless without infrastructure to make it meaningful. I created the data lake architecture that transformed device streams into actionable insights. Real-time data flowed into analytics pipelines that:
- Detected anomalies before equipment failure
- Identified patient risk patterns across populations
- Enabled predictive maintenance reducing downtime by 40%
- Powered research that advanced medical science

**The Architecture Council**

Beyond execution, I shaped strategy. As a member of GE Healthcare's Architecture Council, I influenced cloud and security roadmaps that would guide the company for years. We wrestled with fundamental questions:
- How do you migrate legacy systems to the cloud without disrupting patient care?
- What's the right balance between innovation speed and regulatory compliance?
- How do you build architecture that scales globally while respecting regional data sovereignty?

These weren't theoretical exercises—these decisions affected millions of patients and thousands of healthcare providers.

**The 99.99% Standard**

In most tech companies, 99.9% uptime is excellent. In healthcare, it's unacceptable. We built for 99.99%—and beyond. Because when a doctor reaches for device data during an emergency, "temporarily unavailable" isn't an answer.

Every system design review included the question: "What happens if this fails during surgery?" That mindset drove decisions about redundancy, failover, monitoring, and disaster recovery. We didn't just build reliable systems; we built paranoid systems—because paranoia keeps patients safe.

**The Impact**

By the time I left GE Healthcare, the Edison AI Cloud was connecting and monitoring billions of data points from medical devices globally. Hospitals could predict equipment failures before they happened. Researchers could identify disease patterns across populations. Clinicians had real-time insights that improved patient outcomes.

But the real measure of success? The systems just worked. Doctors never had to think about the infrastructure. Data scientists got the clean, reliable data they needed. IT teams slept better knowing the platform self-healed.

**The Lesson**

Building for healthcare taught me that great engineering isn't just about scale or speed—it's about trust. When lives depend on your code, you don't cut corners. You don't accept "good enough." You build systems that you'd trust if your own family were the patients.

That mindset stayed with me. Every platform I've built since carries that healthcare-grade obsession with reliability.

### The Early Years | 2003 - 2014
**Société Générale | Cognizant | Oracle | TCS**

*Every master was once a student. Every expert was once a beginner.*

Before the cloud revolution, before AI became mainstream, before I led teams of 40+, I was learning the craft. These weren't just jobs—they were classrooms where I earned my stripes, made my mistakes, and discovered what kind of technologist I wanted to become.

**TCS (2003-2007): The Foundation**

My journey began with a single line of code. Fresh out of engineering college, I joined Tata Consultancy Services—India's tech training ground. Here, I learned the fundamentals that still serve me today:
- How to debug production incidents at 3 AM while keeping your sanity
- Why clean code matters more than clever code
- That the best solution is often the simplest one
- How to work in teams where egos check at the door

I wrote thousands of lines of Java, fixed hundreds of bugs, deployed dozens of applications. Some worked perfectly. Others failed spectacularly. Both taught me invaluable lessons.

**Oracle (2007-2009): Scale & Complexity**

At Oracle, I graduated from individual contributor to project leader. Managing distributed teams, coordinating complex enterprise deployments, navigating client expectations—this is where I learned that technology is only 30% of the job. The other 70% is people, communication, and stakeholder management.

I led the deployment of ERP systems for major corporations—projects with million-dollar budgets and zero tolerance for failure. When your go-live date is set and 5,000 employees are waiting to use the new system on Monday morning, you learn what "deadline" really means.

**Cognizant (2009-2012): Architecture & Leadership**

Cognizant elevated me into architecture and management. Suddenly, I wasn't just building systems—I was designing entire technical ecosystems for Fortune 500 clients. This is where I learned to think strategically:
- How do you design for the next 5 years, not just next quarter?
- What's the difference between solving today's problem and building tomorrow's platform?
- How do you balance cutting-edge innovation with enterprise-grade stability?

I also learned leadership isn't about having all the answers—it's about asking the right questions, empowering smart people, and creating environments where excellence emerges naturally.

**Société Générale (2012-2014): Mission-Critical Systems**

Banking changed everything. When you're building systems for a global financial institution, the stakes are visceral. A bug doesn't just crash a system—it could trigger financial losses, regulatory violations, or systemic risk.

I architected enterprise solutions for trading systems where milliseconds mattered and precision was non-negotiable. In finance, you learn what "production-grade" truly means:
- Testing isn't optional; it's existential
- Monitoring isn't nice-to-have; it's survival
- Documentation isn't bureaucracy; it's insurance

But more importantly, I learned that great engineering transcends tools and technologies. Whether you're building trading systems for Wall Street or search engines for e-commerce, the principles remain constant:
- Understand the problem deeply before writing code
- Build for humans, not just machines
- Optimize for maintainability, not just performance
- Design systems that degrade gracefully when things go wrong

**The Thread That Connects**

Looking back across these 11 years and four companies, I see the thread that connects them all: **impact**. At TCS, I impacted application stability. At Oracle, I impacted enterprise efficiency. At Cognizant, I impacted architectural decisions. At Société Générale, I impacted financial systems integrity.

Each role was preparation for what came next. The debugging skills from TCS served me during production incidents at Walmart. The project leadership from Oracle prepared me for managing cross-functional teams. The architectural thinking from Cognizant enabled me to design GE's IoT platform. The precision from Société Générale informed how I approach reliability at Microsoft.

**The Lesson**

There are no wasted experiences. Every project—successful or failed—builds your foundation. Every mistake teaches you what not to do. Every success shows you what's possible.

When people ask me how I went from junior developer to Director of Engineering, I tell them: I never stopped learning, I never stopped asking "why," and I never stopped caring about making things better than I found them.

That mindset, forged across a decade in these companies, defines how I lead today.

## Research Interests

### The Quest for Ethical AI: Fighting Hate Speech with Fairness

Masters in ML & AI (by Research) | Liverpool John Moores University | 2024-2025

In the digital age, hate speech has become a pandemic of its own—spreading faster than any content moderation system can contain. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle with the nuances of human malice: the coded language, the context-dependent slurs, the implicit biases that slip through algorithmic cracks.

**My research asks a critical question:** Can we build AI systems that are not only effective at detecting hate speech, but also fundamentally fair across different communities?

**Research Focus: Persona-Based & Policy-Based Hate Speech Detection**

I'm pioneering a novel approach that unifies persona-based and policy-based signals within Large Language Models for hate speech detection. Think of it as teaching AI to understand not just what is being said, but who it's targeting and why it's harmful.

**The Innovation:**
- Developed a Modular Prompt Validation Framework that systematically evaluates different detection strategies
- Integrated both Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation
- Achieved F1-score of 0.669 on GPT-OSS-20B with superior real-world generalization

**Why It Matters:**
Most AI systems exhibit bias—they're better at protecting some communities than others. My work explicitly addresses three high-prevalence personas: LGBTQ+, Mexican, and Middle East communities, using rigorously balanced datasets (HateXplain and ToxiGen) with over 5,000 carefully curated social media posts.

**Methodology: Science Meets Ethics**

- **Unified Corpus:** 5,151 English social media posts with stratified demographic representation
- **Fairness-First Design:** Explicit balancing across demographic groups and hate/normal content
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Strictly held-out test sets prevent data contamination and ensure reproducibility
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Multiple ablation studies across GPT-OSS (20B, 120B) and GPT-5

**Real-World Impact**

This isn't just academic research—it's about making social media platforms safer and fairer for everyone. The framework provides a scalable, reproducible path for platforms like X (Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit to implement context-sensitive, fairness-aware moderation systems.
