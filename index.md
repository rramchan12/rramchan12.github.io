## 🌟 About Me

I'm a **technologist at heart** and a **leader by passion**. Over the past two decades, I've had the privilege of architecting and scaling some of the world's most complex cloud platforms—from the bustling corridors of Microsoft Azure to the innovation labs of Walmart, and the industrial IoT ecosystems at GE Healthcare.

My journey isn't just about code and infrastructure; it's about **people, impact, and transformation**. Whether it's growing a team from a single engineer to a 40+ person powerhouse, or shaving weeks off ML training cycles, I thrive on solving problems that matter. I believe great technology emerges when empathy meets excellence, and when diverse minds collaborate toward a shared vision.

Today, I'm pushing the boundaries of AI and ML platforms at Microsoft Azure, while simultaneously pursuing cutting-edge research in fairness-aware NLP systems. Because the future of technology isn't just about being faster or bigger—it's about being **fairer, smarter, and more human**.

## 🔬 Research & Academia

### The Quest for Ethical AI: Fighting Hate Speech with Fairness

*Masters in ML & AI (by Research) | Liverpool John Moores University | 2024-2025*

In the digital age, hate speech has become a pandemic of its own—spreading faster than any content moderation system can contain. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle with the nuances of human malice: the coded language, the context-dependent slurs, the implicit biases that slip through algorithmic cracks.

**My research asks a critical question:** *Can we build AI systems that are not only effective at detecting hate speech, but also fundamentally fair across different communities?*

#### 🎯 Research Focus: Persona-Based & Policy-Based Hate Speech Detection

I'm pioneering a novel approach that unifies **persona-based** and **policy-based** signals within Large Language Models for hate speech detection. Think of it as teaching AI to understand not just *what* is being said, but *who* it's targeting and *why* it's harmful.

**The Innovation:**
- Developed a **Modular Prompt Validation Framework** that systematically evaluates different detection strategies
- Integrated both **Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT)** and **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** with LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation
- Achieved **F1-score of 0.669** on GPT-OSS-20B with superior real-world generalization

**Why It Matters:**
Most AI systems exhibit bias—they're better at protecting some communities than others. My work explicitly addresses three high-prevalence personas: **LGBTQ+, Mexican, and Middle East communities**, using rigorously balanced datasets (HateXplain and ToxiGen) with over 5,000 carefully curated social media posts.

#### 📊 Methodology: Science Meets Ethics

- **Unified Corpus:** 5,151 English social media posts with stratified demographic representation
- **Fairness-First Design:** Explicit balancing across demographic groups and hate/normal content
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Strictly held-out test sets prevent data contamination and ensure reproducibility
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Multiple ablation studies across GPT-OSS (20B, 120B) and GPT-5

#### 🌍 Real-World Impact

This isn't just academic research—it's about making social media platforms safer and fairer for everyone. The framework provides a **scalable, reproducible path** for platforms like X (Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit to implement context-sensitive, fairness-aware moderation systems.

*"AI should protect all communities equally, not just the loudest voices or the most represented groups. This research is my contribution to that vision."*
