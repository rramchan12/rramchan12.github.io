## About Me

I'm a technologist at heart and a leader by passion. Over the past two decades, I've had the privilege of architecting and scaling some of the world's most complex cloud platforms—from the bustling corridors of Microsoft Azure to the innovation labs of Walmart, and the industrial IoT ecosystems at GE Healthcare.

My journey isn't just about code and infrastructure; it's about people, impact, and transformation. Whether it's growing a team from a single engineer to a 40+ person powerhouse, or shaving weeks off ML training cycles, I thrive on solving problems that matter. I believe great technology emerges when empathy meets excellence, and when diverse minds collaborate toward a shared vision.

Today, I'm pushing the boundaries of AI and ML platforms at Microsoft Azure, while simultaneously pursuing cutting-edge research in fairness-aware NLP systems. Because the future of technology isn't just about being faster or bigger—it's about being fairer, smarter, and more human.

## � Professional Journey

### 🏢 Microsoft Azure AI | *2024 - Present*
**Director of Engineering – Azure AI Platform (IDC Site Lead)**

*Building the future of AI, one model at a time.*

When I joined Microsoft Azure, the challenge was clear: scale the AI model platform to serve the world's most demanding AI workloads. What started as a single-person mission evolved into leading a **40+ person engineering organization** across Bangalore.

**What I'm Building:**
- 🤖 **Azure Model Scaling Platform** – The engine that powers global AI deployment
- 📚 **Model Catalog** – Think of it as the App Store, but for foundation models
- 🛡️ **Fraud Detection Systems** – Protecting the platform from malicious actors
- ⚡ **Control Plane for Azure Foundry** – High-throughput infrastructure that never sleeps

**The Impact:**
- Launched **GPT5, GPT5.1, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and Cohere** to millions of global users
- Invented **"zero-ops" onboarding** – reduced model integration time by **40%**
- Unified observability systems, cutting incident response time and boosting resolution capacity by **33%**
- Grew the team from **1 → 40+ engineers/managers**, creating a culture of excellence and innovation

*"The best platforms are invisible to their users—they just work, scale, and adapt."*

### 🛒 Walmart Labs | *2018 - 2024*
**Director – Search & ML Platform**

*Making millions of customers find exactly what they need, instantly.*

At Walmart, I led the teams responsible for one of the world's largest e-commerce search engines. Every query, every product discovered, every customer conversion—it all flowed through systems my teams built and operated.

**The Mission:**
Owned the entire **search stack** from typeahead to indexing, runtime to backend. Think of it as building a lightning-fast librarian for a catalog of millions of items, serving hundreds of millions of customers.

**Three Game-Changers I Built:**

1. **🔬 Search ML Experimentation Platform**
   - Greenfield innovation that became the backbone of Walmart's data science
   - **200% YoY growth** in active users
   - Cut ML model training time from **7 days → 2 days**
   - Enabled rapid hypothesis testing that contributed to **$500M topline uplift**

2. **📊 Search Experiment Evaluation Platform**
   - Safe A/B testing at Walmart scale
   - Increased benchmarking throughput by **15%**
   - Sustained **98% accuracy** through ML-based quality interventions

3. **🏗️ IDC Growth Engines**
   - Built and scaled three critical platforms: Experimentation Effectiveness, ML Platform, and Search Facets & Typeahead
   - Transformed how Walmart's global teams collaborate on search innovation

*"Every millisecond matters when millions of customers are searching. We made those milliseconds count."*
